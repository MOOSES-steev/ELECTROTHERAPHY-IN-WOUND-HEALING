The Intelect Mobile 2 is the next generation in physical medicine modalities, its intuitive design is clever and its features, usability and simplicity make Intelect Mobile 2 the choice for today’s modern practice. 
The Intelect Mobile 2 is simple to use and set up thanks to the built in suggested protocol settings developed around the current clinical practices.
Electric stimulation may be able to help blood vessels carry white blood cells and oxygen to wounds, it speeds healing.
Electrical stimulation can help speed wound healing by increasing capillary density and perfusion, improving wound oxygenation, and encouraging granulation and fibroblast activity.

The effect of introducing an exogenous electrical signal into the complex cellular and biochemical events within the wound itself. 
The effect of increasing blood circulation through the wound site by stimulating the operation of the peripheral arterial and vascular systems by means of an electrical signal applied to muscle motor nerves. 
The purpose of wound measurement is to monitor the progress of healing through changes in the length, width, area or volume of a wound.

The body has its own bioelectric system
A current termed the “current of injury” is generated between the skin and inner tissues when there is a break in the skin
Healing of the injured tissue is arrested or will be incomplete if these currents no longer flow while the wound is open
